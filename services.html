                <p>Once the land has been prepared and the site has been marked, 
                    it is time to start digging. We use our own equipment to dig 
                    out the marked area using shovels, excavators, and any other 
                    type of equipment that is required for the scope of the job. 
                    Don’t worry about disposal of the dugout earth as our team also 
                    takes care of disposing of the removed dirt, rocks, shrubs, etc.
                    During this part of the job, we test the soil for stability and 
                    drainage to ensure no issues will be experienced in the future 
                    once the environmental elements come to play
